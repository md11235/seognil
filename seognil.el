;;; Commentary:

;; This is an emacs lisp script to query words in dictionaries in lingoes format

;; How to massage dictionaries from the lingoes format to be usable  by
;; this program:

;; 1. download a java program from the url below:
;; http://dict4cn.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/importer/src/LingoesLd2Reader.java
;; 2. compile it
;; 3. use it to dump contents of a dictionary file in the lingoes format
;; 4. rename the file extension ".output" of a dumped file to ".dict"
;; 5. use gzip to compress that file with the ".dict" extension.
;; 6. sort the content of the file with the extension "idx" using "sort-fields"
;;    with the variable "sort-fold-case" being nil.

;; Put this file into your load-path and the following into your

;; ~/.emacs:
;; (require 'seognil)
;; (setq seognil-dictionary-path "d:/src/lingoes/dict")
;; (setq seognil-dictionaries '("CollinsCobuild" "Collins"))
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d") 'seognil-search)
